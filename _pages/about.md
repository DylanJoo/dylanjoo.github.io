I am a research assistant in the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation at Academia Sinica. 
I currently work in the [CFDA & CLIP Labs](http://cfda.csie.org/) and advised by Professor [Chuan-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/).
Previously, I was a graduate student advised by Professors Howard Hao-Chun Chuang and Yen-Chun Chou. I used to work on econometric modeling and stochastic optimization.
My research interests are in **natural language processing (NLP)**, especially **information retrieval (IR)**. The more specific sub-topics include:

1. Representation learning for IR
    * Multi-view text representations 
    * Retrieval-oriented language models
2. Conversational search
    * End-to-end conversational passage retrieval
    * Conversational question answering
    * Interactive search 
3. Multilinguality
    * Cross-language transfer learning for IR
    * Multilingual summarization 
4. Interpretable NLP
    * Financial report analysis
    * Domain-specific applications (adaptation)

I have also worked on some topics less related or un-related to NLP and IR:
1. Recommender systems
    * Faster recommendation via clustered user-item interactions
    * News recommendation with dense retrieval 
2. Econometrics
    * Time-series modeling
    * Stochastic optimization
