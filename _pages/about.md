Hi there! I'm Jia-Huei (Dylan) Ju, currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Amsterdam. 
I work at the [IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) and am under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Yates](https://andrewyates.net/) since 2024. 
My research focuses on natural language processing and neural information retrieval.

Previously, I served as a full-time research assistant at the Research Center for IT Innovation at Academia Sinica, and was supervised by [Prof. Chuan-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/). 
I completed my master's degree in Management Information Systems from National Chengchi University, where I was advised by Professors Howard Hao-Chun Chuang and Yen-Chun Chou. During my master's program, I specialized in econometric modeling and stochastic optimization.

My recent research interests revolve around representation learning and retrieval-augmented generation, encompassing:

1. Retrieval-enhanced machine learning
    * Enhanced information access
    * Knowledge/context management for multi-stage RAG
    * Retrieval-based language modeling via in-context learning
2. Neural information retrieval (text)
    * Out-of-domain dataset augmentation for weakly-supervised text retrieval
    * Unsupervised representation learning for domain-specific retrieval approaches
3. Specialized text ranking methods
    * Instruction-followed retrieval approaches for knowledge-intensive tasks
    * Passage re-ranking and candidate pruning
4. Interactive (conversational) search
    * End-to-end mixed-initiative response generation
    * Personalized open-domain conversational question answering

Feel free to contact me via email: j.{lastname}[at]uva.nl. I'm open to inquiries and feedback related to my research interests and excited to explore potential research collaborations :)
