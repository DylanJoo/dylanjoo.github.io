I am a full-time research assistant in the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI) at Academia Sinica (AS). 
I currently work in the [CFDA & CLIP Labs](http://cfda.csie.org/), supervised by Professor [Chuan-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/).
Previously, I was a masters student at National Chengchi Unversity (NCCU) advised by Professors Howard Hao-Chun Chuang and Yen-Chun Chou. 

I used to work on econometric modeling and stochastic optimization in my master degree. And currently my research interests are in **natural language processing (NLP)** and **information retrieval (IR)**.
Particularly, the research topics I am working on include

1. Retrieval-based Langugage Models
    * Retrieval-enhanced question answering (e.g., FiD)
    * Retrieval-guided KNN language models
2. Domain-adaptive Retrieval (data-efficient) 
    * Question generation 
3. Multilinguality
    * End-to-end crosslingual dense retrieval
    * Multilingual dense phrase retrieval for open-domain question answering
    * Embedded sentence embeddings in langauges via interaction-level crosslingual alignment 
4. Multimodal Retrieval
    * Image-text contrastive learning with multimodal hard negative
    * Multimedia retrieval applications (e.g., product search, image recommendation)
5. Interactive (conversational) Search
    * Mixed-initiative reseponse generation (e.g., Clarifying questions)
    * Open-domain ConvQA with personalized dialogue 
    * User dialogue simulation
6. Interpretable NLP Applications
    * Domain-specific applications

Also, I've worked on some topics less related to NLP, including
1. Recommender systems
    * Efficient cluster-based recommendation systems
    * News recommendation for personlized ranking
2. Econometrics & Operataional Research 
    * Time-series modeling
    * Stochastic optimization
