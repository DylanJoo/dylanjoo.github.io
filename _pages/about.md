I am Jia-Huei (Dylan) Ju, and I am a full-time research assistant in the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI) at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. 
I currently work in the Computational Finance and Data Analytics and Computational Linguistics and Information Processing [CFDA & CLIP Labs](http://cfda.csie.org/) under the guidance of Professor [Chuan-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/).
Previously, I completed my master's degree in Management Information Systems at National Chengchi Unversity (NCCU) and was advised by Professors Howard Hao-Chun Chuang and Yen-Chun Chou. 
And I am looking for research opportunities, including Ph.D. positions, research internship or any research collaboration.

I used to work on econometric modeling and stochastic optimization during my master's studies. Currently, my research interests are in **natural language processing (NLP)** and **information retrieval (IR)**.
The specific research directions include 

1. Retrieval-enhanced Machine Learning 
    * Retrieval-based language models 
    * Retrieval-enhanced question answering 
2. Zero-shot/Few-shot Learning for Domain-adaptive Information Retrieval 
    * Controllable question generation for few-shot domain adaptation
    * Instruction-tuned dense retrieval for knowledge-intensive tasks
3. Multilinguality
    * End-to-end crosslingual dense retrieval
    * Multilingual dense phrase retrieval for open-domain question answering
    * Interaction-level crosslingual alignment for learning sentence embeddings in langauges
4. Multimodal Retrieval
    * Image-text contrastive learning with multimodal hard negative
    * Multimedia retrieval applications (e.g., product search, image recommendation)
5. Interactive (conversational) Search
    * Mixed-initiative reseponse generation (e.g., clarifying questions, answering, etc.)
    * Personalized open-domain conversational question answering
    * User utterance simulation
6. Interpretable NLP Applications

Feel free to reach out through my email: jhjoo[at]citi.sinica.edu.tw. I appreciatiate any kinds of feedback and would glad to discuss any research ideas!
